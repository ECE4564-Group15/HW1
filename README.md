## Setup

**To setup the functionality please ensure that the following is installed**

1. python3

2. python3 pip

## Usage

The main files that are used are the **client.py** and **server.py** files.

Each file contains the shebang for proper execution. If they are set to be executable then they can be run using ' ./ ' notation.
EX: '**./client.py**'

Additionally, each can be used as input to the python3 interpreter.

Port or address input is not needed. Both the client and server are setup to user port 9005.

Both the client and server application will print out various logs during operation. 

For the client this includes printing out when a tweet is received and transcribing its communications with the server.

For the server this includes transcribing its communications with the server as well as the answers from the Wolfram api.
